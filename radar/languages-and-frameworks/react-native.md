[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a widely-used open-source mobile application framework developed by Facebook. It's recognized for its utility in building applications for Android, iOS, and other platforms using React along with native platform capabilities. Notably, React Native has been adopted by major technology companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Sony demonstrating its versatility and reliability in various sectors. This widespread adoption by industry leaders underscores the framework's capability to handle diverse and complex application needs.
