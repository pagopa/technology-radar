The [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) is a powerful library that brings functional programming concepts to TypeScript development. It provides a set of functional programming abstractions and utilities for building robust and type-safe applications. Leveraging algebraic data types, type classes, and immutable data structures, fp-ts enables developers to write functional, expressive, and statically-typed code in TypeScript.

## Use cases

- Error Handling: Replace error-prone checks and exceptions with structured error handling using `Either` and `Option`.
- Asynchronous Programming: Manage asynchronous operations using `Task` and `TaskEither` monads in a composable and predictable way.
- Expressive Business Logic: Simplify and clarify core application logic using functional abstractions like function composition and pipe.
- Pure Side Effect: Represent side effects with the `IO` monad to keep the code pure and free of hidden side effect.
- Dependency Injection: Manage connections between different parts of the code with the `Reader` monad, promoting modularity and testability.
