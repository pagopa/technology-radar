[Swift](https://www.swift.org/) is an open-source, statically-typed programming
language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. It's the
preferred language to build apps for Apple Mac, Pad and Phone devices.

From [Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/swift/):

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for all Apple
> platforms. It’s easy to get started using Swift, with a concise-yet-expressive
> syntax and modern features you’ll love. Swift code is safe by design and
> produces software that runs lightning-fast.

## Key features:

1. **Open source**: Swift is developed in the open at [Swift.org], with source
   code, a bug tracker, forums, and regular development builds available for
   everyone. This broad community of developers, both inside Apple as well as
   hundreds of outside contributors, work together to make Swift even more
   amazing. There is an even broader range of blogs, podcasts, conferences, and
   meetups where developers in the community share their experiences of how to
   realize the great potential of Swift.
2. **Cross platform**: Swift already supports all Apple platforms and Linux,
   with community members actively working to port to even more platforms. With
   SourceKit-LSP, the community is also working to integrate Swift support into
   a wide-variety of developer tools. We’re excited to see more ways in which
   Swift makes software safer and faster, while also making programming more
   fun.
3. **Safety**: Swift eliminates entire classes of unsafe code. Variables are
   always initialized before use, arrays and integers are checked for overflow,
   memory is automatically managed, and enforcement of exclusive access to
   memory guards against many programming mistakes.
4. **Fast and Powerful**: From its earliest conception, Swift was built to be
   fast. Using the incredibly high-performance LLVM compiler technology, Swift
   code is transformed into optimized machine code that gets the most out of
   modern hardware. The syntax and standard library have also been tuned to make
   the most obvious way to write your code also perform the best whether it runs
   in the watch on your wrist or across a cluster of servers. Swift is a
   successor to the C, C++, and Objective-C languages. It includes low-level
   primitives such as types, flow control, and operators. It also provides
   object-oriented features such as classes, protocols, and generics, giving
   Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers the performance and power they demand.
5. **Objective-C and C++ interoperability**: You can create an entirely new
   application with Swift today, or begin using Swift code to implement new
   features and functionality in your app. Swift code coexists along side your
   existing Objective-C and C++ files in the same project, with access to your
   Objective-C and C++ APIs, making it easy to adopt.

## Use cases

- Swift is currently the preferred language for
  [iOS development](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training).
- Swift is also used for [server-side development](https://swift.org/server/).
  Se also [Vapor framework](https://vapor.codes/).
