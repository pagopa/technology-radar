[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source React front-end development web framework that enables
functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for
React based web applications. It is a production-ready framework that allows
developers to quickly create static and dynamic JAMstack websites.

## Use cases

Use Next.js for any web project that needs server-side rendering, static
generation, and/or file-system routing. It is especially useful for large
applications that need to be built quickly or maintained by multiple developers
like backoffice applications.
