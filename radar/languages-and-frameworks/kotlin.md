[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) is an open-source,
statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and
functional programming. It is interoperable with the Java virtual machine (JVM),
Java Class Libraries and Android.

## Key features

1. **Interoperability**: Kotlin interoperates with Java because they compile to
   the same byte code. It is possible easily call Kotlin code from Java and Java
   code from Kotlin. This makes adoption much easier and lower-risk. There’s
   also an automated Java-to-Kotlin converter built into the IDE that simplifies
   migration of existing code.
2. **Multiplatform**: Kotlin simplifies the development of cross-platform
   projects. The Kotlin applications will work on different operating systems
   like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux and others. For example, you can
   create a Kotlin/JS projects with Gradle as a build system.
3. **Safety**: Kotlin is designed to help avoid common coding errors that can
   break code or leave vulnerabilities in it. The language features null safety
   and eliminating null pointer exception errors.
4. **Concise code**: Kotlin eliminates some of the redundancy in the basic
   syntax of popular languages like Java. Kotlin is a timesaver for developers
   because it provides more concise code. Developers can write programs with
   less boilerplate code, increasing their productivity.

## Use cases

Kotlin was explored and tested for the development of
[Reactive Microservice With Spring Boot](https://spring.io/reactive/).
