[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)is a static site generator based on React.
It is used to build static websites that are progressive web apps, follow the
latest web standards, and are optimized to be highly performant.

GatsbyJs was a good alternative to NextJS, but we prefer NextJS as it's easier
to integrate with our existing ReactJS applications: GatsbyJs phylosophy of
throwing GraphQL everywhere in the mix, makes things more complex than they
could be.

Moreover, NextJS is more mature and has a larger active community while the open
source community around GatsbyJS is not as active as it used to be and the
project looks like it is not evolving as fast as NextJS. See
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md for
the changelog of the GatsbyJS project.
