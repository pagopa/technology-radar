[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) is a versatile programming language that
emphasizes functional programming and a robust static type system. Notable for
its succinctness, Scala was developed with the intention of addressing various
criticisms associated with Java.

However, despite having successfully executed several significant and
high-performance projects using Scala, we have decided to discontinue its use.
This decision stems primarily from two challenges: the scarcity of Scala
developers and the discovery that Scala's key framework, Akka, has a licensing
model that does not align with our business objectives.

Currently, we are in the process of transitioning our existing Scala projects to
TypeScript. TypeScript has gained considerable popularity due to its widespread
adoption and community support, making it a more viable option for our future
development endeavors.
