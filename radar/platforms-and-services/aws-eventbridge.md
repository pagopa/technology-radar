[AWS EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) is a fully managed event bus service that makes it easy to connect different applications using events. It simplifies event-driven architectures by allowing you to ingest, filter, and deliver events from various sources, such as AWS services, integrated software as a service (SaaS) applications, and custom sources. With EventBridge, you can build loosely coupled and scalable architectures, responding to events in real-time. It supports event rules, event buses, and seamless integration with AWS services, enabling event-driven workflows and automation.
