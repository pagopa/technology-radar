[Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/mysql/) is a fully managed relational database service based on the MySQL Community Edition. It was the initial fully managed MySQL service offering on Azure. It provides essential database capabilities but with less configuration flexibility and high availability options compared to the Flexible Server model.

## Use cases

While Azure Database for MySQL is suitable for applications requiring a MySQL backend (e.g., many popular CMS platforms, web applications developed with LAMP stack), its usage is discouraged within our organization.

## Reference of usage in our organization

Our primary strategic choice for database needs often leans towards Azure Cosmos DB due to its flexibility and scalability for various data models. For relational database requirements, we have standardized on PostgreSQL (specifically Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server). Therefore, Azure Database for MySQL (including the legacy Single Server) is placed in the **hold** ring.
