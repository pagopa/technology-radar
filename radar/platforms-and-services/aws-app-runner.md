[AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/it/apprunner/) is a fully managed service that simplifies the deployment of containerized and serverless applications. It automates the process of building, deploying, and scaling applications, allowing developers to focus on code rather than infrastructure. With App Runner, you can deploy applications from source code or container images with automatic scaling and load balancing. It supports popular programming languages and frameworks, providing a quick and efficient way to launch and manage applications. App Runner integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it an easy-to-use platform for building modern, scalable, and resilient applications.
