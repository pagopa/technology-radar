[AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) Amazon SES is a cloud-based email service provider that can integrate into any application for high volume email automation.

With AWS SES it is possible to send marketing emails, templated emails, bulk emails, and so on. More information about the features of SES is available on official documentation.
