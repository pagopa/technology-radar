[Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/single-server/overview) was the initial fully managed PostgreSQL service offering on Azure. It provides essential database capabilities but with less configuration flexibility and high availability options compared to the Flexible Server model.

Microsoft has [announced the retirement](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/postgresql/migrate/whats-happening-to-postgresql-single-server) of Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server, scheduled for **March 28, 2025**. Migration to Flexible Server is strongly recommended.

## Use cases

All legacy applications previously utilizing Single Server have been successfully migrated to Flexible Server, ahead of the official retirement date. The `hold` status remains to strongly advise against any new usage and acknowledge its deprecated status within our infrastructure.
