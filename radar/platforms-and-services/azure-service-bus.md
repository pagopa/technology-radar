## Overview

[Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) is a fully managed enterprise message broker designed to decouple applications and services. It facilitates reliable communication between distributed systems by providing asynchronous messaging capabilities. This ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and improved system performance.

## Use Cases

Azure Service Bus enables asynchronous communication between services, improving system resilience and accelerating message throughput while isolating application dependencies. It provides reliable delivery with guaranteed ordering and dead-letter support to handle processing failures gracefully. Its publish/subscribe capabilities facilitate efficient event distribution to multiple consumers, while queue-based messaging smooths out workload spikes by providing temporal decoupling. With transactional messaging, retry policies, and deep integration with Azure monitoring and scaling features, Service Bus ensures consistent performance and operational predictability across distributed cloud architectures.
