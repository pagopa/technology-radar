[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/it-it/services/devops/) is a set of
services offered by Microsoft for the development of software in the cloud. It
is a complete solution that covers the entire software development lifecycle and
allows you to plan, develop, test, deploy and monitor applications with a single
tool.

Since we switched to GitHub Actions, that offers a similar set of features, but
a better integration with GitHub, we are not using Azure DevOps anymore.

Use Github Actions instead, when starting a new project.
