[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and executes code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an update to a DynamoDB table. With Lambda, you pay only for the compute time you consume, making it a cost-effective solution. It supports a variety of programming languages, and its event-driven model enables seamless integration with other AWS services, facilitating the development of scalable and efficient applications.
