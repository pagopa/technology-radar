[AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling and scaling of distributed systems components. It allows applications to send messages between different parts of a system without directly connecting components. SQS supports both standard and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues, ensuring reliable and ordered message delivery. As a serverless service, SQS eliminates the need for managing infrastructure, providing on-demand scalability and high availability. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it a reliable choice for building distributed and resilient applications.
