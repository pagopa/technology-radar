[tsx](https://tsx.is/) is a command-line tool that enables the execution of
TypeScript files without the need for prior compilation. This tool is akin to
`ts-node`, but it is designed to be faster and more lightweight.

According to a
[runtime comparison](https://github.com/privatenumber/ts-runtime-comparison),
`tsx` is the most complete and fastest cli for TypeScript: it consistently
performs better than `ts-node`.

## Use cases

While `tsx` is currently in the Trial ring, it holds promise for enhancing the
TypeScript development experience. We suggest giving it a try as a replacement
for `ts-node` to assess its advantages in running TypeScript sources without the
need for pre-transpilation.
