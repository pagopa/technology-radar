While [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) has been a popular
choice for bootstrapping React applications due to its simplicity and ease of
setup, we recommend not using it for new projects.

## Reasons:

1. **Limited Configuration:** Create React App has a limited and pre-defined
   configuration, which can be restrictive for complex applications that require
   a more customized setup.

2. **Next.js Advantages:** We recommend using Next.js for new projects. Next.js
   provides advantages such as server-side rendering, static site generation,
   and a file-based routing system out of the box. These features can
   significantly improve the performance and SEO of your applications.

3. **Migration Path:** Next.js also provides a clear migration path for existing
   Create React App projects, making it easier to transition existing projects
   if necessary.

4. **State of the art**: the
   [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)
   recommends using Next.js.
