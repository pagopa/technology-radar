[DevContainers](https://containers.dev/) are a way to configure a consistent
development environment using Docker containers. They allow developers to work
in a standardized environment, regardless of the underlying OS.

- DevContainers are defined using a `devcontainer.json` file, which specifies
  the Docker image, extensions, and settings to use.
- They can be [used with Visual Studio
  Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), allowing
  developers to open a project in a container with a single click.

## Use cases

- Simplifying the setup process for new developers
- Standardizing development environments across different machines
- Ensuring consistency between development and production environments
- Remote development within GitHub Codespaces
