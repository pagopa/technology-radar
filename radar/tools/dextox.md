[Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/) is a gray box end-to-end testing and
automation library designed specifically for mobile apps. Unlike traditional
black box testing methods, Detox allows testers to interact with both the user
interface and the underlying components having some knowledge of the internal
software structure. By providing a comprehensive set of APIs, Detox enables
testers to simulate real user interactions within a controlled environment. The
test runner is agnostic meaning that it can be used with any test framework. It
also works both on simulators, real devices and CI/CD environments with minimal
setup.

## Use cases

- Write end-to-end tests for mobile apps.
- Simulate user interactions with the app's UI and underlying components.
- Cover critical flows with end-to-end tests.
