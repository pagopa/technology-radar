[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is a tool that allows to easily
manage Git hooks. We use it in our projects to run scripts before committing or
pushing code. Husky supports all
[client-side Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks). It's easy to
configure and use, compared to Git hooks, and it's well documented.

## Use cases

Run scripts before committing or pushing code to, for example:

- lint commit messages
- lint code
- run tests
