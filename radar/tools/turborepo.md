[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) is a tool that allows you to manage multiple
packages in a single repository. It provides a monorepo-like experience without
the overhead of a full monorepo setup. Turborepo is designed to work with
TypeScript and JavaScript projects and offers features like shared dependencies,
cross-package testing, and more.

## Use cases

We strongly recommend using Turborepo for managing multiple packages in a single
repository, as it can help streamline your development workflow and improve code
sharing across packages.
