[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) is an open-source API client that's gaining
traction as a lightweight alternative to Postman. What sets it apart is its
"collections as code" philosophy - API collections are stored in plain text
files that can be version controlled, making it a natural fit for developer
workflows. 

The tool offers a fast, native desktop experience with a clean
interface and features like environment variables, request chaining, and
scripting support. While it's relatively new and the ecosystem is still growing,
Bruno's git-friendly approach and focus on developer experience make it worth
evaluating, especially for teams already embracing Infrastructure as Code
principles.

## Use cases

Bruno can be used for API development and testing.
