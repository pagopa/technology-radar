[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found
in JavaScript code. It not only checks for syntax errors but also for best
practices, coding standards, and stylistic issues. It's highly customizable and
extendable, allowing developers to create their own linting rules.

## Use cases

ESLint helps with:

- Enforcing coding standards and best practices
- Identifying potential bugs and security vulnerabilities
- Improving code maintainability and readability
- Enforcing code style conventions across the team
- Integrating with build tools and CI/CD pipelines
