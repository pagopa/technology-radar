[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a testing framework powered by Vite.

> Even if your library is not using Vite, Vitest is an interesting option as it gives you a faster run for your unit tests and a jump in DX thanks to the default watch mode using Vite instant Hot Module Reload (HMR).

> Vitest offers compatibility with most of the Jest API and ecosystem libraries, so in most projects, it should be a drop-in replacement for Jest.
