[K6](https://k6.io/) is an open-source load testing tool designed for testing the
performance of APIs, microservices, and websites. It allows developers to create
and run load tests using JavaScript. K6 is built for modern development workflows and
integrates well with CI/CD pipelines. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for running tests
locally or in the cloud, and it offers a cloud service for distributed load testing.

## Use cases

K6 helps with stressing infrastructure and applications to identify performance bottlenecks,
ensuring that systems can handle expected traffic loads, and validating the scalability of applications.
