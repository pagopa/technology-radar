Diagram as code is an approach to creating diagrams using code instead of a
graphical interface. This allows you to define diagrams in a text-based format
and generate them automatically using a tool that supports this feature.

Here are some advantages of using the "diagram as code" approach:

- **Version Control**: Allows tracking changes over time and easy collaboration
  among team members.
- **Automation**: Diagrams can be generated automatically from the code,
  reducing manual effort and ensuring accuracy.
- **Consistency**: By defining styles and components in the code, you can ensure
  consistency across all diagrams.
- **Portability**: As the diagrams are in code form, they can be easily shared
  and used across different platforms

Always provide a link to the sources and use a tool like
[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) or
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).

## Use cases

- **Architecture diagrams**: Create diagrams to visualize the architecture of a
  system.
- **Flowcharts**: Define flowcharts to represent the flow of a process.
- **Sequence diagrams**: Illustrate the sequence of interactions between
  components.
