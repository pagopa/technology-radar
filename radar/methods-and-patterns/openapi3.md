The [OpenAPI Specification (OAS) v3](https://spec.openapis.org/) is a
widely accepted standard for describing RESTful APIs.

It offers a rich and expressive format that enables developers to design,
document, and consume APIs in a more efficient and standardized way. Adopting
OpenAPI v3 in our organization facilitates better API design, easier
maintenance, and improved API discoverability.

## Use cases

- API Development and Collaboration: In our projects, using OpenAPI v3 has
  enabled our development teams to define API endpoints and models clearly,
  ensuring consistency and reducing misunderstandings. It also allows both
  frontend and backend teams to work more independently yet cohesively.
- Automated Documentation: With OpenAPI v3, we've automated our API
  documentation process, making it easier to maintain and update, thus ensuring
  that our API documentation is always up-to-date and accurate.
- Client SDK Generation: OpenAPI v3 has enabled us to automatically generate
  client SDKs in various programming languages, which has significantly sped up
  the development process and reduced errors.

## Reference of usage in our organization

We successfully implemented OpenAPI v3 in our projects where it streamlined our
API development and documentation process, improving collaboration between our
frontend and backend teams.
